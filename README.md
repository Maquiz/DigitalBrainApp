#  DigitalBrainApp

React Based Zen Desk App with button to Modal functionality.
This project is based off of [Zendesk-React-App-Boilerplate](https://github.com/Cloudhuset/Zendesk-React-App-Boilerplate)


## Development

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:

```sh
cd testZenApp
sudo npm run build
```

Second Tab:

```sh
cd testZenApp
zat server -p dist
```


## Future Goals

- Add Redux for state management
- Expand modal to build out feature
- Use a UNIX system as working on a windows system caused weirness


## Known issues

- Modal intantiates within the app window instead of zen desk window
- Remove bottom scroll bar
